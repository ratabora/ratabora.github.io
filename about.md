Hey there, I'm Ryan Tabora. I love my family, video games (especially RPGs), technology, zombies and anything bruuuutal. I currently work for [Riot Games][riot_games] as software engineer and live out of Santa Monica. Welcome to my personal website where you can find out more about me. Thanks for stopping by.
