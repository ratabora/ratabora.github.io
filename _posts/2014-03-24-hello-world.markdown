I'm starting up a new blog. This would be my first post. Someday I'll look back at this with nostalgia.

So I'm hoping to use this blog to give examples of various coding tricks I use day to day. Here's a test of the code snippit functionality that jekyll offers via markdown.

	public static void main(String args[]){
		System.out.println("Hello world");
	}

Cool, looks pretty good.
